## Description:

This repository contains a heuristic model of the p-innovation ecosystems model together with a toy example for illustrative purposes.

### Abstract 

We propose a method of developing multi-scalar industrial policies based on a spatially
constrained clustering model which combines aspects of complexity, relatedness, and geography.
Our formulation is motivated by recent developments of economic complexity regarding the
evolution of economic output through interactions among industries within economic regions.
This model aims to aggregate a set of geographic areas into a prescribed number of regions
such that the resulting regions preserve key interactions among industries and encourage the
emergence of complex industries. We use Colombia as a case study to illustrate how our mode
can be applied for policy and regional development.
